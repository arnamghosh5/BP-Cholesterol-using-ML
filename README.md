<b><h1><u>Paper Title:</u> Prediction on the Combine effect of Criminal Activity Using Machine Learning</h1><br>
<p>Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular (blood vessel) diseases are among the primary cause of death. Approximately 10 million people every year die having high blood pressure and it was found that 6 in 10 Indians have abnormal levels of blood cholesterol. An increase in blood cholesterol signifies an increase in a man's blood pressure, which can easily lead to abnormal blood pressure,e.g. high blood pressure. Generally, Prediction refers to the output of an algorithm after it has been trained on a dataset. Generally, for making these types of predictions, machine learning algorithms are a very appropriate and most-used technique. A <ins><i>**Multiple Linear Regression**</i></ins> was applied in this study. Data has been analyzed through <ins><i>**Multiple Linear Regression Analysis (MRA)**</i></ins>.</p>
